# Rooted Pixels Network
> A plugin used by Rooted Pixels to manage the core functionality in use by most of the WordPress sites we manage

In an effort to centralize and unify all of the little custom things being modified or added into the admin area of WordPress sites this plugin was created.

- Until plugin functionality to a larger extent has been fleshed out this readme will not contain much useful information
